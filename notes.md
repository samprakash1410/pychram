Day 1 variables and data types:                             git commands:      
*******************************************                 **git init, git status, git add .
variables is a name given to memory location in program     git commit -m "notes", git log,
//name="hp"                                                 git push origin main.**  
//age="45"                                                        
//amoutn=50$                                                remove a file or folder commands:              
print("my name is :",name)                                   mkdir notes > used for to create a files     
print("my age is :",age)                                     rmdir notes > user for remove folder or file in repo.
print("my amoutn is :",amout)//

key words are reserved in python they are 33 types are present in python.
set data_type:
              set is an unorder collection of unique items.set is defined by values seperated by commas inside braces{}.
//student_id={556,557,535}
  print(student_id)
  print(type(student_id))//
dict:
     Python dictionary is an ordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs.
//food_city={'icecream':'turkey','ramens' : 'japan','biryanis':'india'}
  print(food_city)//
operators:
          1.arithematic operators(+*/-)2.relational(==,!=,>,<)3.assignment(=,+=,-=)4.logical(not,and,or)
type casting:
    this method convert the python varaiable datatype into a certain datatype in order to perform operations by users.
input:
  most programs need to collect user data such as name,age,number it is done using input()function

day 2:
string: 
      string is a data type that store a sequence of characters.
contatination:
    using string + operation and replace them using * opertinos.
slicing: 
  is a way to extreat a portion of string by specify start and end indexes.
format():
 another way to format string using format_method.
  name="hp"
  age=45
  amout=50
  print("my name is {} my age is {} my amout is {}".format(name,age,amout))//

list: is also mutable it not be change
 list are order collections of items that allows for easy use of set of data.list value are place in square brackets[].
//fruits=["apple","banana","mango","grapes"]
  print(fruits)
  print(type(fruits))//
types in list:
append():
 add an element to end of a list.
//fruits.append("orange")
  print(fruits)//
sort():
 sorts the list in ascending order default.
//fruits.sort()
  print(fruits)//
reverse():
 reverse the order of the element in a list.
//fruits.reverse()
  print(fruits)//
index():
 return the index of the first occurance of a specific elements.
//print(fruits.index("mango"))//
remove():
 remove the first occurance of a specific elements.
//fruits.remove("banana")
  print(fruits)//

Tuples: is immutalbe it can be change any values by using this"()"
